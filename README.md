# Fun with the #junglegarden

This project has a few objectives:

* Collect data about the #junglegarden. This is my 17th year of having a garden. I would finally like to know how much food we are getting from it.  
* Use it with my Introductory Data Science class. 
* Eventually create a blog to more easily share both R code and gardening ideas, perhaps with two very different groups of people.
